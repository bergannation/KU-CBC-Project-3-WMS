## Description

This is a Warehouse Management System (WMS) application that can assign tasks to users to pick from warehouse inventory. The application keeps track of inventory by item, location, and lot, and keeps a separate record of inventory transactions in a cardex. The application is meant to run in tandem with an ERP system from which orders, items, customers, users, and other parameters are pulled. The application has data structures to support future additional features like receiving and replenishment.

## Deployed Application

The live application can be found at this link:

Although a sign up form has been provided for development purposes, in a production environment, users will be created through an admininistration page from which they will be assigned a profile, including the types of operations that they can perform in the WMS system.
